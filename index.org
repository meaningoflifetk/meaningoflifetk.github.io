Join me, Love Grover, on my journey as I search for the meaning of life. Along the way, I may rely on the assistance of ChatGPT to help me express my thoughts more clearly, as English is not my first language. Specifically, I find ChatGPT's language formatting capabilities to be particularly useful in refining the structure and wording of my content.

During my Master's program, I found myself grappling with the profound question of the meaning of life. As someone who has always been deeply passionate about the pursuit of science, this existential inquiry caused me to hit a roadblock in my progress. While I now recognize that this questioning may have been a futile endeavor, it continues to linger in my mind to this day.

However, I can attest that this experience ultimately strengthened my passion and drive. Despite the obstacles that life may present, I refuse to let them stifle my desire to start anew.

Currently, I find myself ready to take on any challenge, but I am faced with a hurdle of lacking focus and execution. Perhaps my broad range of interests is to blame, but I know that I am a fighter and I will persist in my journey. My next objective is to become a finisher, and though the path ahead may be long and winding, I will not be deterred until I reach my destination.


* Be a finisher

As an individual, my goal is to be a finisher; one who not only starts but also completes what they set out to do. Unfortunately, I often find myself getting caught up in the minutia of the task at hand, causing me to miss the deadline and render my previous efforts futile. In order to overcome this, I realize that I must actively work on improving my time management skills, something that I have long overlooked.

I strive to not just be content with mediocrity but to strive for greatness, to move mountains as it were. I accumulate knowledge and skills with the hope that one day, I can use them to make a positive impact on my country or even humanity as a whole. My approach to change is unorthodox; I aim to become a person of power and influence, who can effect change from within. I recognize that this is a difficult path, and at times, may even seem impossible. But, as an optimist, I know that with perseverance and determination, I can achieve anything.

I use these reflections not as a means of making excuses for my shortcomings but to motivate myself to strive for a higher position in the future. I believe in the power of optimism, and I will continue to work towards my goals, no matter how impossible they may seem.

** Stories

Throughout my life, I have always been an inquisitive person, with a deep-seated addiction to stories. I have always found solace in listening to them, and over time, I have begun to share my own stories in a more expressive way. While I have no trouble explaining situations in my native language, I often find it difficult to convey the same ideas in English.

That being said, I have decided to share stories that I find interesting and meaningful, whether they be my own experiences or those of others. I have always been drawn to stories with a moral lesson, which is a staple of Indian literature. But I also enjoy artistic stories and movies that offer a deeper understanding of characters and the choices they make.

As a child, I was particularly fond of side characters who possessed heroic traits or emotional depth. However, over time, I have grown to appreciate and even fall in love with the main characters, who possess a depth of integrity that can often seem unreal in practicality. I use the examples of Hanuman and Rama to illustrate this point. While as a child, I was enamored by Hanuman's supernatural powers, as I grew older, I began to admire and appreciate the willpower of Rama. It was Rama's determination that ultimately led to the reality of Hanuman's powers.

In conclusion, my love for stories and the characters within them has been a constant in my life. I hope to share my thoughts and experiences with you, and to continue to explore the depths of human nature through the stories we tell.

*** Rama vs Ocean

Fury raged within Lord Rama, the scion of the Sun, as he stood at the brink of the tumultuous ocean. His people were suffering, and his beloved wife Sita had been taken by the accomplished yet nefarious pandit, Ravana. Despite his vast knowledge of shastras, including science, political science, and the arts, he had become blinded by his own ego, and his actions had turned nefarious. Rama knew that the only way to reach Lanka and rescue Sita was to cross the ocean, and he needed a path to do that. His determination to succeed in his mission was unshakable, and he knew that with his unwavering willpower and focus, he could overcome any obstacle. He was guided by his deep sense of duty and moral code, and his determination to succeed in his mission was unyielding.

As he loaded his arrow, the ocean trembled beneath him, a testament to the immense power and fury that he held within him. The god of the ocean knew that he had to act fast. "Forgive me, Rama," boomed a voice across the water, "I have not been attentive to your offerings. I have been in deep yogic state myself, doing offerings to you and not realizing the passage of time. Now, I see the urgency of your request, and I am honored to offer you a way to cross the ocean. I will guide you to two intelligent engineers, Nal and Neel, who are part of King Sughreev's Vanar Sena, your allies. They will make it possible for you to cross over to Lanka with your army."

Rama's face broke into a smile, and he felt a sense of triumph and purpose. He knew that he had the blessings of the god of the ocean, and with his army led by his ally King Sughreev, he set out on his journey. The Vanar Sena, adorned in monkey makeup and artificial tails, set out behind him, ready to fight and conquer in the name of their leader, Lord Rama. Together, they marched towards Lanka, with the blessings of the god of the ocean and the determination to succeed in their mission.

As the embodiment of righteousness and honor, Rama's willpower, focus, and determination are truly unmatched. His unwavering unwavering commitment to righteousness and his deep sense of duty and moral code have earned him the respect and reverence of even the gods, making him the most powerful being in the universe. His strength, courage and unwavering commitment to righteousness will be remembered forever, inspiring future generations to be strong, courageous and unwavering in the pursuit of righteousness.
